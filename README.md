To show my basic Python skills I prepared a simple calculator and an even more simple movie library.

### CALCULATOR

The calculator performs the following operations:
     - retrieves information which operation we want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
     - fetches values for two arguments a and b, drawing the user's attention when he does not enter numeric values. The user can retype them.
     - for addition and multiplication, it is possible to add any number of arguments. The user may make mistakes in entering data,too.

### MOVIE LIBRARY

The library:
     - stores information about movies and series in a list
     - has methods, e.g. "create_seasons()" for adding episodes to series or "top_titles()" that will return a selected amount of the most popular titles from the library
